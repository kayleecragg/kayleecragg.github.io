      I rewatched one of my favourite films, rise of the guardians, and I adored that 
      <a href="https://youtu.be/V1ejrlYY1Qs" target="_blank">prologue</a> 
      scene where the moon pulls Jack Frost out from the water, up through the ice, and onto a frozen lake where he discovers his powers and starts ice skating.
      <br><br>
      I wanted to recreate that sort of larger than life feeling, so i imagined what the people of the middle ages saw when they believed the earth was flat; 
      a boat at the edge of the world, something that you can just sail right off of.

  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">
    <p>
      I was inspired by the character of The Man in the Moon, and I wanted to make the moon so comically large it almost towered over you, 
      yet still feel warm and inviting, like an omnipresent deity that was watching over you.

I rewatched one of my favourite films, rise of the guardians, and I adored that [prologue](https://youtu.be/V1ejrlYY1Qs) scene where the moon pulls Jack Frost out from the water, up through the ice, and onto a frozen lake where he discovers his powers and starts ice skating. I wanted to make a scene that gave the same feeling.
