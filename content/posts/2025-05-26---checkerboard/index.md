- Developed a real-time tennis tournament checkerboard web application using **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** that aggregates live match data from a custom-made API (hosted on **Vercel**).
- Able to give notifications when a match changes court or players.
- Widely used by my companyâ€™s live operations team during large tennis tournaments to keep up to date on court and player changes, as well as to keep track of the matches on their assigned court.
