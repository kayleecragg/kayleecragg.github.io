## Features
- Developed a Countdown website with **HTML** leading up to the 3 different acts of Arcane Season 2.
- Checks viewer's local timezone via **Javascript** and displays exactly what time the episodes will go live in their timezone.
- Allows users to check other timezones for when the episodes will go live.
- Responsive background feature that cycles through images and GIFs from the new trailers at random.
