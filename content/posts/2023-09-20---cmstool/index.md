- Made with **HTML, CSS, Javascript**, hosted on **Firebase**. I scraped all the information from my company's website.
- Developed a web app that acts as a CMS (content management system) tool to help organize large volumes of assets.
- Initially created to demo a nonâ€‘functioning tool to pitch to workplace's product team.
