Hi, I’m **Kaylee!**

I am currently an undergraduate pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of New South Wales (UNSW).

In the past, I have worked on various [projects](/)
 and at various [companies](/work/).

## About the website
This website was built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React framework that generates these static pages at build time. It is optimal framework for sites like these with no dynamic data generated to achieve the best performance. I am also using the [open source lumen starter](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen).
